# üé¨ YouTube Video search engine with Gradio interface

**A Python-based tool that downloads subtitles from YouTube videos, stores them in a vector database (ChromaDB), and allows users to query video content using Gradio. It returns three closest answers with the links to the exact moments in the video where the phrases are.**  


## **How it works**
You can pass a link to a YouTube video or the entire channel. The script then will download subtitles for the video (videos) and store them in a vector database. Then you may make queries to the database to find the exact moment on the video without the need to rewatch it. 
Note: by default the script downloads subtitles for 120 latest videos on the channel. If you want to change this number, please, go to selenium_parser.py and change the number of scroll downs of the page. The more video you pass at once the longer they will be processed. It takes 12-15 seconds to process one video.
The script uses GPT or Gemini to create embeddings but it can be changed to use any other model you like. To change this go to create_databse.py
By default script returns 3 closest answers to the query. You may change this number in the script query.py
